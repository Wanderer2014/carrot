# Carrot - tensorboard for PyTorch
============

Carrot is a web application that uses MySQL to get data with loss, accuracy, optimezed parameters and gradients that allows to visually see what is happening inside neural network.

---

## Features
- Visually see gradients and parameters in development
- Analyse losses and accuracy
